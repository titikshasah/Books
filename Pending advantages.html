Its a stack of knowledge in any kind of field. It helps us to grow. Every knowledge can't be found in books but every knowledge can be put into books in any either forms.

<p style="font-size: 22px";>We live in a world where people feel the pressure of portraying themselves as strong and stoic as if nothing bothers them and nothing can penetrate their steel. If circumstance had the power to bless or harm, they would bless and harm all men alike, but the fact that the same circumstances will be alike good and bad to different souls proves that the good or bad is not in the circumstance, but only in the mind of him that encounters it. What does the lion think of when he sees an elephant? When the lion looks at an elephant, the word that comes to his mind is lunch, he doesn’t see with his eyes but with his mind, because he has no sense of limitation and that proves the principle of difference right, between a leader and follower, successful and failure, you are as big or as small as you see yourself(in the mind). If the front side of the coin of success is the ability to set clear goals for yourself, then the flip side of the same coin is the ability to get yourself organized and work on your most valuable tasks, every day. Books are an Escape from reality.</p>

<p style="font-size: 22px";>Don’t let success meet you accidentally or it will leave you accidentally. Success should not come by luck, it must come deliberately. Success is when opportunity meets preparation. Robert Kennedy said, “I do not fail, I succeed in finding out what does not work. Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly”.</p>

<p style="font-size: 22px";>Money is not the most important thing in life but money does affect everything that’s important. Spoken words leave a lasting impact.Sometimes they’re like a sledgehammer. We swing away without thinking and end up with a pile of relationship rubble.Sometimes they’re like a saw, cutting people down.If we keep using these tools without careful thinking, inevitably our relationships are going to suffer.One reason we aren’t constructive with our words is we don’t realize how powerful they are.Stop excusing, stop saying, “I didn’t really mean to say that.”Realize that what you say impacts everyone around.</p>

  <p>This is The National Library of Korea, located in Seoul, South Korea and was established in 1945. It houses over 10 million volumes, including over 1,134,000 foreign books and some of the National Treasures of South Korea.
It was relocated within Seoul, from Sogong-dong, Jung-gu to Namsan-dong in 1974, and again to the present location at Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, in 1988. It was transferred from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Culture in 1991.Libraries in Korea came into being due to the major influence Western ideologies had on Korea as well as Japanese Colonialism. Both of these influences began the modernization of Korea. The first denomination of the library was officially established in 1906 by Lee Keun-sang, Lee Beom-gu and Yoon Chi-ho. It was named the Daehan Library. The Daehan Library, however, was never made public and 100,000 books were confiscated by the Joseon Government in 1911</p>
